Welcome to Service-connector project at CoronadoLand factory

The Service-Connector is a repository in Github. This repository provides an architecture to create faster applications using the SOA paradigm. The flexibility of SOA provides the powerful of services development for a complex system. Developing system "by services" is like constructing huge buildings "by bricks".

Service connector links the browser with Java services. It's based on Spring Framework and jQuery framework. The connector is multi layer and multi language architecture because it needs part on Java (business layer) and it needs part on Javascript to browser layer. Both layers connect via JSON protocol using AJAX.
